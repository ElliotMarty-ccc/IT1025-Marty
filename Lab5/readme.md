# Executive Summary
Lab 5 is all about learning about networking, as well as encryption technologies.
### LucidChart
LucidChart is a website that allows you to visualize and then make flowcharts, which can act as psuedo-code in some cases. I can imagine this making coding somewhat easier in the future labs.
## Introduction to Networkin
### Data Transmission
A packet is a unit of data.
Packet-switching is technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address.
Your IP address is your unique identifying number.
DNS is a directory of IP addresses.
Protocol is set of rules that allow many devices to talk to one another.
### Network Hardware
A switch can be considered better than a hub for a handful of reasons. One reason being that a switch is more "intelligent" due to it being able to regulate traffic and thus maximize security and efficiency.
Hubs and switches are for grouping computers in a local area together, while routers are needed for goruping computers outside of the same local area.
### Network Topologies
A single point of failure is when the main switch or hub fails, which causes every machine on that network to stop working. Two examples of this would be a Ring or Star topology failing.
I think that Infrastructure is better because even if one line goes down, the system still maintains good operating power.
### Network Design
I created my network to be similar to what my home has. We have a protecting our system, which leads to a router, which leads to switchs, which lead to some computers and phones.
## Cybersecurity and Encryption
### Information Systems Security
Confidentiality would mean that only people that need to know the customers private information would know it. Integrity assures that the information has not been changed in any way, and availabiltiy means that only people that are allowed to change it can see and change it at any point in time.
One task that requires authentication is logging into my Tri-C account or my github account. I need my username and passwords for both, and they could enable 2FA by emailing you, asking if you are the one trying to sign into the account. The second task would be unlocking a phone. Normally you just need your finger print, but it could require your finger print, your password, and a secrety hint to reach multi-factor authentication. The third task that involved authentication is using an atm. You typically need to use a credit card to access your atm, but you could also put in a pass phrase only you know, or a long code.
An ACL shows who can access what data. It is simple to understand and maintain, but if a security administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of information resources, it would be quite difficult. The more users there are, the harder it is to maintain. RBAC's assign roles, and then give each role specific permissions. This allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying administration and, by extension, improving security. The only drawback is that is isn't as specific as ACL.
A public key encrypts the message, the encrypted message is known as a cyphertext, and the private key decrypts the encrpted message.
Public key cryptography makes it so you don't need to sneak the decryption key to the target reciever.
### Cryptography
The Caesar cypher functions by shifting each letter the same amount of "spaces" down.
THe Frequency fingerprint might change with different languages because the words of other languages are spell differently of course.
The polyalphabetic cipher seeks to "flatten" your keyboard fingerprints. It tries to equalize the letters that you use.
It changed some of the letters so that the message would have  a more equal distribution of letters.
### Brute-Force
Brute forcing something is when you make a program to try every single possible combination until you find the correct one. Brute forcing a four number code would be like 0000, 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, etc... until 9999 or until you find the correct code.
# Conclusion
This lab helped introduce different types of encryption processes, as well as introducing LucidCharts, a useful website for possible planning code.
