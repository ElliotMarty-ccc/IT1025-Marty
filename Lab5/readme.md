# Executive Summary
Lab 5 is all about learning about networking, as well as encryption technologies.
### LucidChart
LucidChart is a website that allows you to visualize and then make flowcharts, which can act as psuedo-code in some cases. I can imagine this making coding somewhat easier in the future labs.
## Introduction to Networkin
### Data Transmission
A packet is a unit of data.
Packet-switching is technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address.
Your IP address is your unique identifying number.
DNS is a directory of IP addresses.
Protocol is set of rules that allow many devices to talk to one another.
### Network Hardware
A switch can be considered better than a hub for a handful of reasons. One reason being that a switch is more "intelligent" due to it being able to regulate traffic and thus maximize security and efficiency.
Hubs and switches are for grouping computers in a local area together, while routers are needed for goruping computers outside of the same local area.
### Network Topologies
A single point of failure is when the main switch or hub fails, which causes every machine on that network to stop working. Two examples of this would be a Ring or Star topology failing.
I think that Infrastructure is better because even if one line goes down, the system still maintains good operating power.
### Network Design
I created my network to be similar to what my home has. We have a protecting our system, which leads to a router, which leads to switchs, which lead to some computers and phones.
