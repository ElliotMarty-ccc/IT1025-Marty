Lab 6 is all about Internet Architecture and Programming. We will be learning about different sets of rules or protocols that govern in the internet, as well as programming methodologies. We will also be creating a website with HTML and CSS
## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
An IP address is a unique number assigned to any device that is connceted to the internet. If it has internet connection, it has a unique IP. IPv4 and IPv6 are both types of IP's, but IPv4 is 32-bit, whereas IPv6 is 128-bit. IPv4 has around 4 billion different address, but that isn't enough to keep up with today's demand, which is where IPv6 comes in with it having around 2^32 amount of unique address, which is safe to say that it will never run out.
