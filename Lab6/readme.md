# Executive Summary
Lab 6 is all about Internet Architecture and Programming. We will be learning about different sets of rules or protocols that govern in the internet, as well as programming methodologies. We will also be creating a website with HTML and CSS
## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
An IP address is a unique number assigned to any device that is connceted to the internet. If it has internet connection, it has a unique IP. IPv4 and IPv6 are both types of IP's, but IPv4 is 32-bit, whereas IPv6 is 128-bit. IPv4 has around 4 billion different address, but that isn't enough to keep up with today's demand, which is where IPv6 comes in with it having around 2^32 amount of unique address, which is safe to say that it will never run out.
The purpose of ICANN is to moniter IP addresses. They maintain the central repository for IP addresses and help coordinate the supply of IP addresses. They basically make sure everything about IP's is running smooth.
### TCP/IP
TCP/IP, which stands for "Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol", defines the details of how data is sent to and from all the switches, hubs, routers, and other network devices of the internet.
TCP/IP acts like dialing a phone number. The client is the one dialing the phone, and the server is the one who is waiting for the phone to ring.
Layers are important with changing tech, because if one layer is changed or gotten rid of, the other layers are generally unaffected. This saves alot of potential hassle and problems from happening.
The software of a computer runs on the application layer.
### Internet Security
HTTP gives users the ability to interact with web resources. The client requests HTML pages, and the server responds with the pages.
HTTPS uses encryption algorithms to encrypt everything that is sent across the web to ensure that no one unwanted reads your personal info.
### Securing Your Web Browser
Not securing your browser can make it easy for attacks to install unwanted software on your computer, but securing it makes the attackers job muhc more difficult.
If you don't secure your browser, spyware can be installed, which means that your personal information is personal no longer.
## Internet Programming 
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. W3C was created with the purpose of making all website look the same of similar no matter what browser you use.
The Web Designs and Applications standard makes sure that every site is usable by everyone.
