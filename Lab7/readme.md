# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to learn what file compression is, as well as defing OOP and practicing making software.
### File Compression
File compression is a way to group together a handful of files, which in turn makes them take up less space. They then need to be unzipped afterwards, which expands them to their original form.
The reason why a zip file is smaller than a jpg would be, is because the zip is lossy compression, whereas the jpg is lossless.
