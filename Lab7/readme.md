# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to learn what file compression is, as well as defing OOP and practicing making software.
### File Compression
File compression is a way to group together a handful of files, which in turn makes them take up less space. They then need to be unzipped afterwards, which expands them to their original form.
The reason why a zip file is smaller than a jpg would be, is because the zip is lossy compression, whereas the jpg is lossless.
### Python OOP
The methods of the shark are to swim, and to be awesome.
The purpose of the constructor, is to excecute code from top to bottom. It will run whatever is right after it, without going through the entire code.
The class is basically the blueprint for the object. The object is the general "name" for the class code. Instantiating an object from a class is giving a name to the class. Like in the example, where the shark class is named sammy.
### Object Oriented Concepts
The classes would be what you want on your food. If you get a burger, your class would be bun, patty, letuce, tomatoe, pickle. The object is the name the menu gives that item.
inheritance=a specific type of shark---class=sammy---object=swim(self)---abstraction=definition of a shark---inheritance=shark
# Conclusion
This lab helped me learn about compressing files in the zip format, as well as learning about class/objects
