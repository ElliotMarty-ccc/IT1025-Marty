## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 2 is to explore the purpose of various pieces of computing hardware, and to explore conversion, such as decimal, binary, and hexadecimal conversion.

## Hardware
### Hard drives
The difference between latency and transfer rates is that latency is the amount of time it takes a hard drive to find the location of a piece of data on the disk. Transfer rates is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk.
An SSD is different from a tradition HDD because the SSD is stored on data chips that retain even when there is no power. They are also usually faster and more reliable.
### Memory
Increased RAM makes the speed at which memory transfers fast. More programs can be loaded and there are less programs swapping in and out
32-bit systems can have 2^32 addresses, which is about 4 GB of RAM, whereas 64-bit systems can have 2^64 addresses, which is almost 18 quintillion bytes of RAM
### ALU and the Control Unit
The CU gets and breaks down instructions from the RAM, and then sends them to other processes, including the ALU. THe control unit takes instructions and tells the ALU what to do. The ALU preforms, and then outputs an answer.
### CPU, Input and Output
Input - You swipe the barcode for the bread over the scanner.
CPU - The system finds the cooresponding barcode of the bread you are buying
Output - The screen displays the bread you want, along with the prices of it.
### Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table shows the output you get for every possible input and a NAND gates produces and output which is false only if all inputs are true. The outcome of a NAND gate complements the output of an AND gate.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE's purpose to is to foster innovation that benefits humanity, not harm us. Ethics are very important in device design. For example, Apple could easily steal alot of our personal data. They could just switch on the microphones on all iPhones and then record what they hear, and sell the important info. It is very easy to go un-ehtical, but the IEEE exists to help prevent that.
## Data Representation
### Numeric Conversions
Decimal are just normal numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,etc... Binary is just 1's and 0's, otherwise known as base-2. Binary is the common launguage that computers use. Hexadecimal is base-16, which means 16 different digits can appear, from 0-15.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff means 171, 0, 255 in RGB. It is a purple color.
I don't belive it would be, as the oppisite of #ab00ff is #54ff00, which is a bright green.
