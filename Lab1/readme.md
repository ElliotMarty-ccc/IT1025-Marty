### Executive Summary
The purpose of lab 1 was as an intro to the class. It explored a couple different ideas in technology, and also had us create our own GitHub repositories, to make it easier to share classwork.

### Information Systems Components
# An information system that I use everyday would be my phone.
Hardware - The physical phone case. Protects the other hardware within, such as the battery.
Software - Apple IOS. All iPhones use the Apple IOS in order to function as a phone
Data - iPhones can collect a wide range of data, such as location, how many steps you've taken, your contacts, emails, what day it is, and so on.
People - Anyone who has an iPhone
Process - The iPhone can do many different processes in order to function. If you want to know if some buisness is open, you would search on google. Your phone would get your loction, then find the buisness closest to you using your location, and then tell you.


## GitHub
# Client-Server
 Client-Server architecture is a model that the server hosts, manages, and delivers most, if not all of the data, resources, and services that the client uses. The server being GitHub, and the client being you/myself.
 # Cloud Cimputing
 Cloud computing is being able to store and access data without direct active manipulation of said data. Some other cloud computing environments I use might be Google Drive or Google Classroom.
 
 ### Conclusion
 Through the course of this session, I learned the basic requirements of IT1025, and I also learned about some basics of computing. I'm feeling pretty okay about GitHub. It's kinda confusing to navigate at first, but once you learn where stuff is, it is much easier.
