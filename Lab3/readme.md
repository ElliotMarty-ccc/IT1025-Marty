## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 3 is to define multiple software types and to explore careers and future paths in IT

### Software
Operating systems control computer hardware and act as an interface for the application software. The utility software helps to manage, maintain, and control the resources of the computer.
An operating system would be Windows, an application would be something like Google Chrome, and utility software would be Windows Defender, and anti-virus program.
ERP software is an integration of many different programs into one program. One example of ERP software would be a program that can manage warehouse stock for buisnesses.
The purpose of virtualization is to be able to manage workloads by using multiple operating systems on the same computer.
### Virtualization
Using virtualization, you could more effectively manage your servers' workloads.
The hypervisor is what lets you run different operating systems on the same computer.
### Option A
Cloud computing is being able to access or manipulate data in the cloud without having direct access to the data. Virtualization is being able to create many different simulated environments on the same pc. Cloud is an environment, whereas virtualization is a technology.
You can create a cloud in a virtual interface by just pooling together a bunch of virtual resources together, orchestrating them using management and automation software, and then making a self-service portal for yourself.
### Python
Python is a pseudo-code, which means that is written in the typical code way, but it is meant for human reading, instead of just computer reading.
Compiled lanugages are typically faster and more efficient than interpreted code. Compiled code is directly converted into computer language.
## Career Exploration
### College Central
The website would be very useful for finding jobs in the near future for my prefered path. It's a clean layout of the site with many different and helpful options.
### Certifications
All 3 of the sites would all be very useful for when/if I take the tests. The CISCO website offeres many different ones depending on the degree you want to get as well.
### Co-ops / Internships
A coop education allows the student to get hands on experience in the field of their choice. In order to become coop ready, you need to have completed 12 credit hours of college coursework with at least two courses related to your major field and have a GPA of 2.75 or higher. This allows you to gain useful hands-on experience in your chosen field of work.
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
The IEEE is a group of people who strive to create new technology that can benefit humanity. This would be pretty beneficial to be in because you can stay up to date on some bleeding edge tech, as well as being able to see some new technology being made for progression of human kind.
