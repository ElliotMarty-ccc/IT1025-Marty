## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 3 is to define multiple software types and to explore careers and future paths in IT

### Software
Operating systems control computer hardware and act as an interface for the application software. The utility software helps to manage, maintain, and control the resources of the computer.
An operating system would be Windows, an application would be something like Google Chrome, and utility software would be Windows Defender, and anti-virus program.
ERP software is an integration of many different programs into one program. One example of ERP software would be a program that can manage warehouse stock for buisnesses.
The purpose of virtualization is to be able to manage workloads by using multiple operating systems on the same computer.
### Virtualization
Using virtualization, you could more effectively manage your servers' workloads.
The hypervisor is what lets you run different operating systems on the same computer.
### Option A
Cloud computing is being able to access or manipulate data in the cloud without having direct access to the data. Virtualization is being able to create many different simulated environments on the same pc. Cloud is an environment, whereas virtualization is a technology.
You can create a cloud in a virtual interface by just pooling together a bunch of virtual resources together, orchestrating them using management and automation software, and then making a self-service portal for yourself.
### Python
Python is a pseudo-code, which means that is written in the typical code way, but it is meant for human reading, instead of just computer reading.
Compiled lanugages are typically faster and more efficient than interpreted code. Compiled code is directly converted into computer language.
