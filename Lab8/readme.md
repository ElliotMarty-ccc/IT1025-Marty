# Executive Summary
In this lab, we will learn about various database models and use SQL. We will also talk about ethical implications of some technology.
## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Relational Data
Data is context to information. Knowledge is objective information, and information is refined data.
The primary key would be what they want. They are related in that the order relates to a specific table. A foreign key is what time the order was placed.
The data type definition is important so that you don't get confused while working with lots of data.
### Big Data
Volume - the amount of data
Velocity - motion of the data
Variety - types of data
Veracity - trustworthiness of data
Social Media increase the amount of big data by alot.
### SQL Injections 
SQL injections can be used in order to gain information you shouldn't have by using 1=1 to make the system return more information than it should. You can use SQL parameters to protect against this happening. The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally.
## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
A code of ethics is an outline of what is allowed and what isn't. It is agreed to by all of the group and users. ACM created one so that no one is treated unfairly or incorrectly.
A CoE applies to people who work in the group, and the AuP applies to people who use the technology the group creates.
### Intellectual Property
The WIPO is a group that seeks to make a more balanced IP system that promotes creativity.
A copyright is gained just by making whatever it is you made. Copyrighting is important so that some random person doesn't steal what you made.
It might be important to copyright my svg image because some person may take it and claim it as theirs. It's unlikely, but it could happen.
### Information Collection
COPPA requires parental permission in order to collect data on those under 13. FERPA protects US student records, and HIPAA gives patients the right to control their medical records.
